# JSONPath

THIS PARSER IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

The JSONPath data format parser parses a JSON string into metric fields using [JSONPath][https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/] expressions. For supported
JSONPath query expressions check out [this article][https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/]. Examples for how this parser works can be found under the `testdata` directory, there you can find sample JSON, Telegraf configs, and expected metrics.
